## Weekly Breakdown

### Week 1: Build Internal Network
- Install internal network using Cisco switches, routers, devices, and a server.
- **Deliverables:**
  - Cisco Packet Tracer & GNS3 Network Design.
  - Network should include:
    - 3 Routers
    - 2 Distribution Switches (DSW)
    - 4 Access Switches (ASW)
    - 20 PCs
    - 1 Server

### Week 2: Configuration for Access & Distribution Switches
- **Tasks:**
  - Configure VLANs, trunk ports, EtherChannel, STP root bridge.
  - Secure ports using BPDU guard and port security.
  - Save configurations to NVRAM.

### Week 3: Configuration for Routers
- **Tasks:**
  - Configure basic settings (hostname, passwords, banners).
  - Implement static and dynamic routing (OSPF, EIGRP, or RIP).
  - Set up DHCP, NAT, and ACLs.
  - Conduct connectivity tests and troubleshoot.
